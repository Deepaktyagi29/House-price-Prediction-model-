1. Project Overview

“This project predicts house prices in California using machine learning.”

“The goal is to take historical housing data and build a model that can estimate the price of a house based on features like location, number of rooms, population, and other factors.”

2. Dataset

“I used the California Housing dataset from Kaggle, which contains around 20,000 rows and features like median_income, total_rooms, house_age, and ocean_proximity.”

“For faster experimentation, I took a subset of 1000 rows for my demo.”

3. Data Preprocessing

“Handled missing values by removing incomplete rows.”

“Converted categorical data, like ocean_proximity, into numeric codes so the model can understand them.”

“Selected features (X) and target variable (y) — the target is median_house_value.”

4. Model Training

“I used Linear Regression because it’s simple, fast, and interpretable.”

“Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate performance fairly.”

“Fitted the Linear Regression model on the training set.”

5. Evaluation

“Predicted house prices on the test set.”

“Evaluated the model using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² Score.”

“For example, the model achieved RMSE ≈ 71,000 and R² ≈ 0.62, which shows it can explain 62% of the variance in house prices.”

6. Key Learnings / Highlights

“Gained hands-on experience with Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn.”

“Learned how to preprocess data, encode categorical variables, split data, train models, and evaluate performance.”

“Understood the importance of feature selection and scaling in machine learning.”

“I can further improve accuracy using Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting.”

“Hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering can reduce error by ~20%.”
